CKA Practice Questions
Welcome to the CKA Practice Questions repository! This collection is designed to help you prepare for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam. The questions here are a mix of ones I’ve crafted myself and others generated with the assistance of AI tools. They are intended to reflect the style and difficulty of the actual CKA exam, though they are not official questions. Feel free to use these resources for your own preparation, and I encourage you to share them with others who might benefit from them!
